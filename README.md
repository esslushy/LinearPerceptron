# Linear Perceptron
Recently, in my Mathematics of Data Models course, we learned how a linear perceptron worked. I found it very interesting and decided to write my own linear perceptron in python. This was not assigned for any class and was completely self led. I utilized Seaborn's penguin dataset for this project. 

# To Run
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run `python Main.py`

# Notes
I received some feedback for this project from my data models professor, so I am incorporating them into this model. This v1.0 branch is for preservation of my original work, while master will include the improvements suggested by my professor.
