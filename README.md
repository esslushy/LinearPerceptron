# Linear Perceptron
Recently, in my Mathematics of Data Models course, we learned how a linear perceptron worked. I found it very interesting and decided to write my own linear perceptron in python. This was not assigned for any class and was completely self led. I utilized Seaborn's penguin dataset for this project.
